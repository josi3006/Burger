# Burger
An app using node, express, MySQL and handlebars that allows the user to "create" a burger.  The user creates a burger by typing in the input box, and hitting the "Make It!" button.  The burger they create appears on the left.  When a burger's "Eat It!" button is clicked, the burger moves to the "devoured" side of the page.

The deployed app can be found here:  https://tranquil-shelf-77232.herokuapp.com/

Here is a screenshot of the app:
