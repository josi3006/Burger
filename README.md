# Burger
An app using node, express, MySQL and handlebars that allows the user to "build" a burger.  The user can "name" a burger by typing in the input bos, and hitting the "Make It!" button.  The burger they create appears on the left.  When a burger's "Eat It!" button is clicked, the burger moves to the "devoured" side of the page.

Here is a screenshot of the app:
